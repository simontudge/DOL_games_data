Additional figures that I might consider adding to the paper, or to the final PhD at some point, but are not currently included in the paper or write up at the moment.

relative_fitness_parental:
	The fitness of the pure, mixed and full model relative to the maximal possibly atainable.
	That is the fitness for each odel divided by the highest possible. R increasing from left to 
	right, three models pure: top, mixed : middle, full : bottom.

reactive_vs_parental :
	Shows the fitness as a fraction of the total possible achievable for the reactive model (top) and 		the parental model (bottom).
